Tail risk reduction means minimization of high losses due to market volatility. Via its intraday long-short volatility exposure, the systematic AI driven investment process of the software aims to use the S&P 500 volatility as an additional return contributor. The Volatility Opportunities Algorithm strategy software is in live trading with clients since May 2016.
